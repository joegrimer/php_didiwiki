PHP DidiWiki
Version 1.1 
6may2017

This is a PHP version of didiwiki.

All the files are found in the v*.* folder (which ever is the latest version)

To install: simply copy the folder onto your PHP/Apache server, and run it by navigating to the wiki.php file.

You need not worry about SQL, as this wiki stores data purely on (easily copyable) txt files!

I hope you find it useful. Please notify me of any bugs!
