=== Eating my own Dog food - notes made while developing

*the last bug?* - something to do with complex internal links and strikethrough... need to regex it out

/also/ I just tried to save this file, and something odd happened. the problem didn't reocur though

Todo on wikis

* I need to cull excess test pages (like "hello", and "Changes") and wiki#.php files
* take a copy, archive it

Old bugs in this *PHP* version of didiwiki... eating my own dog-food!

I'm sure there's an odd thing I missed. There really are a lot of regular expressions!

== Obvious Problems:

The code is a tad botched in parts... but I do think the way it deals with <pre>'s is quite clever

== Old Bugs:

The first line of every file behaves lika  *mutant*

-The edit > redirect is also a bit unreliable... I think *maybe* this is /just because/ of some refresh -features- of _php_- *DONE* 

 here is a pre line to split this test

  


-I'm *not* sure if doubele *bold* or *triple* bold *works*- *DONE*

-or this <- *DONE*

-I need to fix the pre tag so that it functions on another level, and can let everything else do its own thing- *DONE*

-italic seems to /not be/ be broken- *DONE*

-The last line of most of the documents seems to be cloned. 5 characters are missing off the following line:-

-or randomly preformatted-

=== This was the Last Remaining problem:
